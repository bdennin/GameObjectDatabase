# GameObjectDatabase
The Game Object Database is a C++ application, that utilizes Boost and QT to provide a user the ability to graphically modify a database.  The current data implementation is that of a video game; it was originally intended to save data associate with such a game.  Nevertheless, it could be used for manipulating and storing any data a user may find relevant.  The directory contents are in disarray because of the way Visual Studio likes to store its projects.  Eventually, I would like to get away from using this IDE, and instead use something more primitive like make.

Since this was my first-ever program written in C++, I had the great experience to be around real memory.  Getting used to pointers, dereferencing, using addresses, and other C constructs was difficult at first, but now it is the way I prefer to code.  I'm really glad I chose to write this program in C++.  It's now my preferred language.  Also, I must mention, that QT is the absolute best GUI maker for any platform that I've ever used.  If I ever need to create another GUI, and I will, it will be in QT.
